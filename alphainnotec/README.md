# alpha innotec

Connect nymea to alpha innotec heat pumps. 

In order to use the modbus interface, it is important to enable modbus on the heatpump using the Windows tools from Alpha Innotec. 
The instructions for that can be found in the user manual of the heat pump. 

Please also make sure all values are configured as readable and writable for modbus, otherwise the heapump can only be monitored, but
not optimized for smart heating. 

## Supported Things

* alpha connect

## Requirements

* The package 'nymea-plugin-alphainnotec' must be installed
* Both devices must be in the same local area network.
* Modbus enabled and all values are readable and writable.
