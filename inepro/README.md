# inepro Metering

This plugin adds support for the inepro Metering PRO380 energy meter connected via Modbus RTU.

# Setup instructions
First, set up a Modbus RTU resource using the configured settings of your meter. Once
that's set up, the PRO380 can be set up like any other thing. During discovery, nymea will
offer the configured Modbus resources as possible connections. Select the one that
you've set up previously.
