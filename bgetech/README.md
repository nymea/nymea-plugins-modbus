# B+G E-Tech

This plugin adds support for the B+G E-Tech SDM630 and SDM72 energy meter connected via Modbus RTU.

# Setup instructions
First, set up a Modbus RTU resource using the configured settings of your meter. Once
that's set up, the SDM630 and SDM72 can be set up like any other thing. During discovery, nymea will
offer the configured Modbus resources as possible connections. Select the one that
you've set up previously.
